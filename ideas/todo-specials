These are compiler features that I need to implement, and then a
special form that can be used to invoke them.


== gen ===

(gen ((bindings) . &body) expr)

similar to pythonic

(&body for bindings in expr)

only implement the generator version, and if you need a list, call
list on it.


=== defgen ===

(defgen name (formals)
  ...
  (yield x))

similar to pythonic

def name(formals):
   ...
   yield x


=== binary operands ===

** * @ // / % + - << >> & ^ | and or

All of the binary built-in operands should be converted from function
calls to operator invocations in special forms that reduce from left
to right

see BINARY_*


=== unary operands ===

not ~ + - iter

The unary conversions:
UNARY_NOT UNARY_INVERT UNARY_POSITIVE UNARY_NEGATIVE


=== item ===

Should become BINARY_SUBSCR


=== comparators ===

< <= == != > >= in not-in is is-not

All of the comparisons built into the COMPARE_OP should be converted from
function calls o operator invocations in special forms


# The end.
