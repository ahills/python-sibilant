Thank you for your interest in sibilant!

The sibilant issue tracker is at
https://github.com/obriencj/python-sibilant/issues

If you have noticed a bug, please file an issue explaining the
environment and problem, as well as the expected behavior.

If you have a feature request, please file an issue describing the new
behavior.

If you have a patch for a bug or feature, please make sure to file
first, and submit a pull request second!

Submitted code should pass flake8 as configured, and all existing unit
tests should pass. If you are adding new features, you should have
unit tests which verify and exemplify their use.


There are probably more rules to add to this, but I'm tired and nobody
will ever read this, so I'm going to bed.
